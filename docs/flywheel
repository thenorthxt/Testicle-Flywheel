## Flywheel Model

We model a closed-loop reinvestment system.

### State Variables
- **Budget (B)**: resources available for exposure
- **Exposure (E)**: distribution reach / impressions / placements
- **Attention (A)**: engagement, holders growth, mentions
- **Demand (D)**: buy intent, net inflows
- **Liquidity (L)**: depth, volume, spreads

### Dynamics (conceptual)
- Fees → B
- B → E via spend efficiency
- E → A via conversion
- A → D via narrative + social proof
- D → L via volume + LP growth
- L supports price stability and amplifies E (more people watch what moves)

Goal: maximize *sustained rotational momentum* (compounding visibility), not one-off spikes.
